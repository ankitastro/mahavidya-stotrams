TIPS FOR SUCCESS
================================================================================

1. ALBUM ARTWORK IS CRITICAL
   - Don't upload without proper artwork
   - It represents your brand and affects discoverability
   - Consider hiring a designer on Fiverr if needed

2. TRACK TITLES MATTER FOR SEO
   - Use the titles from the metadata JSON - they're SEO-optimized
   - Include key terms like "Mantra," goddess names, and benefits
   - Keep under 100 characters if possible

3. RELEASE DATE STRATEGY
   - If you have artwork ready: upload now, release in 2-3 weeks
   - This gives time to:
     * Set up pre-saves
     * Build social media buzz
     * Contact playlists curators
     * Create promotional content

4. AFTER UPLOAD - PROMOTION
   - Create individual YouTube videos with visualizers
   - Share on social media with links
   - Submit to Spotify playlists (there are thousands of devotional playlists)
   - Post on spiritual/yoga/meditation forums
   - Email your website subscribers

5. YOUTUBE STRATEGY
   - Upload videos to your "Astrokiran" YouTube channel separately
   - Use the descriptions from YouTube_Upload_Guide.txt
   - Create a playlist linking all 10 videos
   - YouTube Music will auto-generate from YouTube uploads
   - But also submit via DistroKid for proper artist profile


================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

PROBLEM: Artwork rejected
SOLUTION: Check it's exactly square (1:1 ratio), RGB mode, no text/URLs

PROBLEM: File upload fails
SOLUTION: Ensure files are WAV or FLAC, not MP3. Check file isn't corrupted.

PROBLEM: Don't have artwork yet
SOLUTION: Use Canva (free) or hire on Fiverr ($5-20). Search "album cover design"

PROBLEM: Unsure about track order
SOLUTION: Use the 1-10 order from the metadata JSON (Kali first, Kamala last)

PROBLEM: Title too long
SOLUTION: DistroKid allows up to 200 characters, but some stores truncate at 100
